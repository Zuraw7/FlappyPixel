# FlappyPixel
A small FlappyBird clone

# About
FlappyPixel is my first project using the raylib library. It was created to understand its operation and get used to using it. The rules are simple, fly, score points and don't fall into pipes!

# How to play
To run the project you need the raylib library installed.
If you don't have it, here's how to download it:
  - Linux: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux
  - Windows: https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib/purchase?popup=1 (you can set 0$)

Next step is to download project:
``
  git clone https://github.com/Zuraw7/FlappyPixel.git
``

Get to project repository:
``
  cd FlappyPixel
``

Build it using script file:
``
  bash build.sh
``

Or manually:
``
  cmake .
  make
``

Then run and play!
``
  ./FlappyPixel
``

If you want to remove all extra files created use: (This will also delete executable file)
``
  bash clear.sh
``
or manually run commands included in file.

Thanks for looking at the game!!
